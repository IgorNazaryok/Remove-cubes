> ### Rules game
<br>
In one minute, you need to remove as many cubes as possible.
                      The game consists of two levels. The first level is an 8x8 field, the second level is a 12x12 field.
                      Initially, there are 2 colored cubes on the field - yellow and purple. After 20 game points are collected, red cubes are added to the field, after 50 points - green ones.
                      Purple and yellow cubes are removed by left-clicking, red and green by double-clicking with the left mouse.
                      Points are awarded for removing each cube. For a purple cube you get 1 point, a yellow one - 2 points,
                      red - 3 points, green will add one game second to you.
